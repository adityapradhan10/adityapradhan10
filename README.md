### Creating is my passion
I started my career in Jamnagar, Gujarat where I studied Bachelor of Computer Applications and then completed my Masters in Computer Applications at The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.

I always loved creating things and turning my ideas into reality and later I found out that to be my passion, so I started studying computer applications and programming languages by which I can digitalize my ideas. I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years, and therefore I have decided to share my knowledge via social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Linkedin.
