### Creating is my passion
I started my career in Jamnagar, Gujarat where I studied Bachelor of Computer Applications at the University of Saurashtra and currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications at a reputed university in Gujarat.

I always loved creating things and turning my ideas into reality and later I found out that to be my passion, so I started studying computer applications and programming languages by which I can digitalize my ideas. And within a few years, I got a good grip on the IT world and therefore I decided to share my knowledge via social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer.
