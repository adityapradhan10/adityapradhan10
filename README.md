# Hi there 👋

### “ Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead. ” - Morihei Ueshiba

My life gist :

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Personal Brand Development, and trying to provide best content on social platforms.
- 📚 What do I beleive? Jack of all, Master of a few things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage my time, and be productive.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any idea that impresses me.
- 💬 Ask me about Mobile Development(Android, React Native, Flutter), Web Development, Design, Marketing, Sales.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am in love with tea. ☕

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey,
and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the
game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions
has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt
of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background,
spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another
vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer.

I started my career in Jamnagar. Where I studied: Bachelor of Computer Applications at the University of Saurashtra and currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications at the Marwadi University.

### Creating is my passion
I always loved creating things and turning my ideas into reality and later I found out that to be my passion, so I started studying about computer applications and programming languages by which I can digitalize my ideas. And within few years I got a good grip in IT world and therefor I decided to share my knowledge via social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.
