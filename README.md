# Hi there 👋

### “ Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead. ” - Morihei Ueshiba

My life gist :

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Personal Brand Development, and trying to provide best content on social platforms.
- 📚 What do I beleive? Jack of all, Master of a few things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage my time, and be productive.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any idea that impresses me.
- 💬 Ask me about Mobile Development(Android, React Native, Flutter), Web Development, Design, Marketing, Sales.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am in love with tea. ☕

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey,
and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the
game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions
has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt
of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background,
spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another
vertical of mine which was to do marketing and become an influencer.

Being a influencer I think social media is a tool you can use to leverage your digital identity, an identity on which only you have the control. I am a product of
digital identity and strongly believe in creating an online presence aka personal brand.
